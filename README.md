the list for this year:

Penn CAMB -- never applied to penn ever but this year i will, im on a paper with her https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Bartolomei so i want to have a zoom meeting with her august/sep, ive met her before, maybe shes taking in students lets see

Penn Genomics and Computational Biology -- i emailed the program director for Penn CAMB and they said i was a better fit for GCB, if i get in im going to use my savings to buy a condo in philly near campus ... something with good parking and an EV charger

University of Maryland BISI -- computational biology phd -- safety school, i would need an apartment that has EV charging and i want to live in bethesda again, there are some Rust people at UMD

Rutgers Biochemistry -- i dunno how this is going to turn out -- send out emails to PIs todayyy -- they said i have a competitive application i just need good LoRs hmmmm getting in here would be great bc i can teach that bioinformatics class. i asked if i should write in my personal statement that i want to continue teaching bioinformatics as a phd student, apparently not the best idea??? "That's tricky, normally as a grad student you would be a GA (graduate assistant) or a TA (teaching assistant) from the second year on. All of these are considered full time positions and as a consequence you would not be able to be a lecturer. Just concentrate your personal statement on your research journey. You could say that you would be interested in being a TA for computational courses, as the SGS now encourages grad students to TA for at least one year. But the PIs are jealous of their graduate student's time and frown upon any more teaching duties than what is strictly required." i would be a great TA though lol, i would be like so serious but a little funny at times

NYU Biomedical Sciences -- i have to start emailing them for zoom meetings in august -- send out emails to PIs todayyy -- https://med.nyu.edu/research/vilcek-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/phd-program/phd-program-admissions they opened up their app, i emailed some PIs today, Virtual Open House: October 2, 2024, at 12:00PM EST

Tri-I -- no one responds to any emails at this school ("never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence"), so unprofessional, whats the point in asking for zoom meetings, ill just apply whatever  -- send out emails to PIs todayyy -- okay so one person responded and they suggested i apply to the IMP PhD Program https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/programs/immunology-microbial-pathogenesis i guess i will do that
