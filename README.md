University of Maryland BISI -- computational biology phd -- safety school, i would need an apartment that has EV charging and i want to live in bethesda again, there are some Rust people at UMD

Rutgers Biochemistry -- i dunno how this is going to turn out

NYU Biomedical Sciences -- i have to start emailing them for zoom meetings in august

Tri-I -- no one responds to any emails at this school ("never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence"), so unprofessional, whats the point in asking for zoom meetings, ill just apply whatever
