the list for this year:

Penn CAMB -- never applied to penn ever but this year i will, im on a paper with her https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Bartolomei so i want to have a zoom meeting with her august/sep, ive met her before, maybe shes taking in students lets see

Penn Genomics and Computational Biology -- i emailed the program director for Penn CAMB and they said i was a better fit for GCB, if i get in im going to use my savings to buy a condo in philly near campus ... something with good parking and an EV charger

University of Maryland BISI -- computational biology phd -- safety school, i would need an apartment that has EV charging and i want to live in bethesda again, there are some Rust people at UMD

Rutgers Biochemistry -- i dunno how this is going to turn out -- send out emails to PIs todayyy -- they said i have a competitive application i just need good LoRs hmmmm getting in here would be great bc i can teach that bioinformatics class. i asked if i should write in my personal statement that i want to continue teaching bioinformatics as a phd student, apparently not the best idea??? "That's tricky, normally as a grad student you would be a GA (graduate assistant) or a TA (teaching assistant) from the second year on. All of these are considered full time positions and as a consequence you would not be able to be a lecturer. Just concentrate your personal statement on your research journey. You could say that you would be interested in being a TA for computational courses, as the SGS now encourages grad students to TA for at least one year. But the PIs are jealous of their graduate student's time and frown upon any more teaching duties than what is strictly required." i would be a great TA though lol, i would be like so serious but a little funny at times

NYU Biomedical Sciences -- i have to start emailing them for zoom meetings in august -- send out emails to PIs todayyy -- https://med.nyu.edu/research/vilcek-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/phd-program/phd-program-admissions they opened up their app, i emailed some PIs today, Virtual Open House: October 2, 2024, at 12:00PM EST

mskcc cancer engineering phd -- applying to this https://www.sloankettering.edu/gerstner/cancer-engineering -> "Integrative Computational Biology and Oncology" the faculty are the mskcc software engineering iv computational oncology group, maybe this works out instead i dunno "The Cancer Engineering PhD degree is registered as a biological sciences degree with the New York State Education Department under the HEGIS code: 0499.00 (biological sciences, other). This degree is not registered under engineering and will not lead to a professional license. " ohh interesting

Tri-I -- no one responds to any emails at this school ("never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence"), so unprofessional, whats the point in asking for zoom meetings, ill just apply whatever  -- send out emails to PIs todayyy -- okay so one person responded and they suggested i apply to the IMP PhD Program https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/programs/immunology-microbial-pathogenesis i guess i will do that -- the app opened, i looked at it quickly, it now asks "Which areas of research are you most interested in? Please list up to three areas of research:" so i have to figure that out based on the labs im interested in ... __peptide therapy & glp-1s__ thooo lol im gonna add that no one can stop me lol

this is for tri-i: "Thanks for your interest in our program and sorry for the delay in getting back to you. It looks like you have very extensive and relevant experience.
-----
Regarding GPA, admission to our program is quite competitive: less than 10% of our applicants receive offers of admission, and the average GPA of the applicants invited to interview is around 3.8. We have interviewed and admitted students with low undergraduate GPAs, usually those candidates are ones like yourself with extensive bioinformatics experience and papers but in almost all cases, those candidates also had a Masters degree with high GPA. **In the rare exception, we had direct knowledge of the candidate and their ability to thrive in our program.** Neither of those two things guarantees that the candidate will be invited to interview."

"The committee assesses approximately 400 applications, they tend not to have the bandwidth to look at anything besides the application package and perhaps some papers."

"Thank you for your interest in our lab.
You have a fantastic background and if you come to the Tri-I I would love to speak to you about the work in our lab in the gene regulation and cancer space. Yes, I would have availability for a trainee such as yourself and look forward to meeting you once you come here for an interview."

from a PI i emailed ... yeah but the program gets 400 applicants ughh
-----
"Nice to e-meet and thanks for reaching out. You look like a great candidate for the programs, and I’d certainly encourage you to apply.

I’m not able to meet with prospective applicants beforehand, so I’d encourage you to list me as a faculty member for either program that you’d be interested in working with and we can continue the discussion there. 

Best of luck applying— I think you’ll do well! "

yeah ... but they get 400 applicants :-|
-----
UCSD Bioinformatics and Systems Biology PhD https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/admissions/grad/admissions -- maybeee

im really interested in peptide therapy, trying to find labs at each school where someone is working on it, im gonna mention it in my personal statement

Yale Computational Biology and Biomedical Informatics -- https://cbb.yale.edu/ never applied, likely this cycle

sometimes people are so slow at responding to emails
